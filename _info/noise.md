# Noise

## What does Noise even mean?

Noise determines how quiet or how loud your PSU is. It may or may not be important to you depending on your preferences and the location of the PC.

# Noise Graphs

There are two main types of graphs: **Average Noise** and **Color charts**. Average noise is the average noise figures of the PSU, while Color charts give you an accurate representation of the noise figures at X wattage. Because of this, I reccomend using color charts as they are more accurate and are easy to read.

Good sources for Color charts include:

[Hardware Busters](https://hwbusters.com/)

[Cybernetics](https://www.cybenetics.com/)

and more.

**IMPORTANT: Cybernetics LAMDBA ratings are SEPARATE from color charts!**

# How to read Color Charts

**IMPORTANT: Cybernetics always keeps the fan on, so on units like the RMx (2024), hardware busters will give you a better representation of noise levels at low wattages!**
