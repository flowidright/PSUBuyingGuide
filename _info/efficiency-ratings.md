# Efficiency Ratings

## What is an efficiency rating?

An efficiency rating is a rating that certifies that your PSU is above a certain efficiency level. Contrary to common belief it does NOT indicate the quality of a unit.

## Which efficiency ratings should you trust?

There are two main efficiency ratings, 80 PLUS and Cybernetics ETA. 
Unlike 80 PLUS, Cybernetics uses more points of measurement, 
and the methodology is much stricter. They also test additional data of PSUs, 
making them a good database for PSU performance and noise. Because of this, 
I maintain that Cybernetics will be the go-to PSU rating company in the future 
and their ratings are the better option.
