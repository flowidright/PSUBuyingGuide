# Flow's PSU Buying Guide


**This guide aims to be the most useful guide it can be for people looking for a PSU tailored to their needs. This guide will NOT include every PSU on the market (for now!) but it WILL include close to every PSU that is widely available in the US/UK/Europe markets + some of the asian exclusive PSUs with trusted reviews.**

# Tiering

**The reccomendations will be split into 3 tiers:**

**Baller: Some of the best units on the market. They will most likely be overkill, so only buy if you have a large budget!**

**Mainstream: High-end PSUs that will be for most people. They will be a good balance of price and performance.**

**Budget: PSUs oriented towards Budget systems. They will often lack creature comforts like modular cables, but they will be the best option if you are on a budget or building a low-power system.**

**IMPORTANT: PSUs are ranked from top to bottom within the Tiers.**
